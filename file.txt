Approach I: probing the model by composed rules

We probe the GPT-J model with composed rules and the RHS score is perplexity, where the lower perplexity means the higher liklihood.
Note: When we generate composed p(instead of composed rules), we should rank the composed p by unliklihood, which means less plausible to model
